* Here I wrote a program to create a simple chatbot that can answer about Chronic Kidney Disease and it's symptoms and causes.<br>
* After fetching the data from the website, I wrote a script to generate the bot_response according to the user_response.<br>
* This is a simple code and it needs lots of modifications and upgrades to generate a wider range of bot response.

Url from which data is fetched: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521
